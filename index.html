    <h2>Top 3 movies</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Mouse</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite K-drama. The suspense was insane. It was everything I did not expect it to be. Plus I emotionally connected to the lead character.</p>
    <h3>Ginny and Georgia</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite American Series. The acting was top notch. I connected to the series in every way. My favourite character is Georgia.</p>
    <h3>Breath of Life</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite Nollywood movie. The story was well told plus I almost cried in a scene.</p>
